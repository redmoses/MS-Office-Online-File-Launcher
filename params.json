{"name":"Poom","tagline":"Open document files with Microsoft Office online version on your browser.","body":"Poom\r\n=====\r\n\r\nOpen document files from your linux file explorer in the free Microsoft Office Online version on your browser.\r\n\r\n## What?\r\nThe app is primarily a dropbox client. When a document file is opened using the app it uploads the file to your Dropbox\r\nand opens it from there using Microsoft Office Online. I have built the app using \r\n\r\n-\tPython 2.7.8\r\n-\tThe superb [Dropbox API](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/core/docs/python) for python.\r\n\r\n## Why?\r\nI know Microsoft is Evil, but no matter what you can't deny one of their best creations, and that is Microsoft Office.\r\nWith the free online version we can now use it on linux as well. And who are we kidding, Open Office or Libre Office \r\nare not even close to the online free version of Microsoft Office. So this is why I set out on this mission, primarily \r\nto satisfy my own needs :)\r\n\r\n## How?\r\nThe app doesn't have any permission over your existing Dropbox files. So when you open a document with the app it first \r\nuploads the file to its own directory on your Dropbox and then open the file from there using the Microsoft Office \r\nonline edition.\r\n\r\n## File Syncing Feature\r\nOnce you've edited the file in Dropbox the changes are going to be temporarily saved there. The next time you open the \r\nsame file using this app it will show you the last modified version of the file, meaning if the file was last modified \r\non Dropbox it will open the Dropbox version and sync your local file and vice versa.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nFor system installation using pip\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsudo pip install poom\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor installing from github source\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone https://github.com/redmoses/poom.git\r\ncd poom\r\npython setup.py install\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nAfter installing the app, use the following command to open document files\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npoom /path/to/office/document\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
