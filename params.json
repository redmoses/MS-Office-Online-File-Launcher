","body":"# Poom-Poom\r\nOpen document files from your linux file explorer in the free Microsoft Office Online version on your browser.\r\n\r\n## Why?\r\nI know Microsoft is Evil, but no matter what you can't deny one of their best creations, and that is Microsoft Office.\r\nWith the free online version we can now use it on linux as well. And who are we kidding, Open Office or Libre Office \r\nare not even close to the online free version of Microsoft Office. So this why I set out on this mission, primarily \r\nto satisfy my own needs :)\r\n\r\n## How?\r\nThis is primarily a Dropbox app and acts as a Dropbox client. The app doesn't have any permission over your existing\r\nDropbox files. So when you open a document with the app it first uploads the file to it's own directory on your \r\nDropbox and then open the file from there using the Microsoft Office online edition.\r\n\r\n## And finally with What?\r\n* Python 2.7.8\r\n* The superb [Dropbox API](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/core/docs/python) for python.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
