When a document file is opened using the app it uploads the file to your Dropbox\r\nand opens it from there using Microsoft Office Online.\r\n### Technology\r\n-\tPython 2.7.8\r\n-\tThe superb [Dropbox API](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/core/docs/python) for python.\r\n\r\n## How?\r\nThe app doesn't have any permission over your existing Dropbox files. So when you open a document with the app it first \r\nuploads the file to its own directory on your Dropbox and then open the file from there using the Microsoft Office \r\nonline edition.\r\n\r\n## File Syncing Feature\r\nOnce you've edited the file in Dropbox the changes are going to be temporarily saved there. The next time you open the \r\nsame file using this app it will show you the last modified version of the file, meaning if the file was last modified \r\non Dropbox it will open the Dropbox version and sync your local file and vice versa.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nFor system installation using pip\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsudo pip install poom\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor installing from github source\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone https://github.com/redmoses/poom.git\r\ncd poom\r\npython setup.py install\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nAfter installing the app, use the following command to open document files\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npoom /path/to/office/document\r\n```\r\n","google":"UA-46861903-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
