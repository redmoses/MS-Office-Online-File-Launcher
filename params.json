With the free online version we can now use it on linux as well. And who are we kidding, Open Office or Libre Office are not even close to the online free version of Microsoft Office. So this is why I set out on this mission, primarily to satisfy my own needs :)\r\n\r\nHow?\r\n----\r\n\r\nThis is primarily a Dropbox app and acts as a Dropbox client. The app doesn't have any permission over your existing Dropbox files. So when you open a document with the app it first uploads the file to its own directory on your Dropbox and then open the file from there using the Microsoft Office online edition.\r\n\r\nAnd finally with What?\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\n-\tPython 2.7.8\r\n-\tThe superb [Dropbox API](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/core/docs/python) for python.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
