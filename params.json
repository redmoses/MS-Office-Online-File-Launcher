{"name":"Poom","tagline":"Open document files with Microsoft Office online version on your browser.","body":"Poom\r\n=====\r\n\r\nOpen document files from your local file system in the free Microsoft Office Online version on your browser.\r\n\r\n## What?\r\nThe app is primarily a dropbox client. When a document file is opened using the app it uploads the file to your Dropbox\r\nand opens it from there using Microsoft Office Online.\r\n\r\n### Technology\r\n-   Python 3 \r\n-\tPython 2.7.8 (older version 0.0.2)\r\n-\tThe superb [Dropbox API](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/core/docs/python) for python.\r\n\r\n## How?\r\nThe app doesn't have any permission over your existing Dropbox files. So when you open a document with the app it first \r\nuploads the file to its own directory on your Dropbox and then open the file from there using the Microsoft Office \r\nonline edition.\r\n\r\n## File Syncing Feature\r\nOnce you've edited the file in Dropbox the changes are going to be temporarily saved there. The next time you open the \r\nsame file using this app it will show you the last modified version of the file, meaning if the file was last modified \r\non Dropbox it will open the Dropbox version and sync your local file and vice versa.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n### Latest version (Python 3)\r\n\r\nFor system installation\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsudo pip install poom\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf Python 3 is not the default interpreter in your system then you must install the package using pip3\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsudo pip3 install poom\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor installing from github source\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone https://github.com/redmoses/poom.git\r\ncd poom\r\n# for python2 as the system's default python\r\nsudo python3 setup.py install\r\n# for python3 as the system's default python\r\nsudo python setup.py install\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Installing version 0.0.2 (Python 2)\r\n\r\nFor system installation\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsudo pip install poom=0.0.2\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nAfter installing the app, use the following command to open document files\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npoom /path/to/office/document\r\n```\r\n","google":"UA-46861903-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
