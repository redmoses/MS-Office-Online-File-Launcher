# Poom-Poom
Open document files from your linux file explorer in the free Microsoft Office Online version in your browser. 

## Why?
I know Microsoft is Evil, but no matter what you can't deny one of their best creations, and that is Microsoft Office. With the free online version we can now use it on linux as well. And who are we kidding, Open Office or Libre Office is not even close to the online free version of Microsoft Office. So this why I set out on this mission, primarily to satisfy my own needs :)

## Ingredients
* Python 2.7.8
* The superb [Dropbox API](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/core/docs/python) for python.
